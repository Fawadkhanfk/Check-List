use email Hunter Api 

# Step 2

Every time you register a domain, you have to provide details about your company or
business, such as the name, phone number, mailing address, and specific email
addresses for technical and billing purposes. The domain registrar will also store the IP
address of your authoritative DNS servers.]

```glsl
amass intel -org <company name here>

Mostly, it’s good for finding root domains and additional subdomains that belong to a company. It can do this in a number of ways. Firstly, there’s the “reverse whois” method.
```

![FromStart%207495f2ed2e014eeaad18bceca242aa74/2.png](FromStart%207495f2ed2e014eeaad18bceca242aa74/2.png)

```glsl
amass intel -active -asn <ASN Number Here>

If you want to find the ASN of a company, Amass can do a nice convenient search. For example, if I wanted to find ASN’s associated with Tesla, I could use this:
```

```glsl

amass intel -active -cidr <CIDR Range Here>

it pulls the SSL certificate from every IP address within the IP range and then spits back the domain that the SSL cert is associated with

```glsl

amass intel -whois -d <Domain Name Here>

Essentially it takes the details from the specified domain’s whois records, and then tries to find other domains with similar whois records.
```

Then Again Run the Subdomain tools on the live One and repeat the resolve step again to resolve

# Step 4

# **Subdomain Brute Force**

Subdomain Brute Force is a Tecnique where You Can find The root Domain hidden from normal Access Using 

[projectdiscovery/shuffledns](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/shuffledns)

```elixir
shuffledns -d [http://site.com](http://site.com/) -w wordlist -r resolver.txt -o output
```

Run a brute force with some custom options:

[blark/aiodnsbrute](https://github.com/blark/aiodnsbrute)

```elixir
$ aiodnsbrute -w wordlist.txt -vv -t 1024 [domain.com](http://domain.com/)
```

## Altdns

```elixir

```

## Dnsgen

 is  a good one 

```elixir
cat domains.txt | dnsgen - | massdns -r /path/to/resolvers.txt -t A -o J --flush 2

Tip: Never forget to look for hidden parameters in the source code. click view source code and search for “hidden”, “input”, or “var” parameters.

# TOP 10 OWASP VULNERBILTIES

# Crawling

Use This Scanner and cheak for owasp vulnerbilties

[pikpikcu/XRCross](https://github.com/pikpikcu/xrcross)

Tips

```jsx
if a site uses
1 **AngularJS,**
 test {{7*7}} to see whether 49 is rendered anywhere.
If the application is built with [ASP.NET](http://asp.net/) with XSS protection
enabled, you might want to focus on testing other vulnerability
types first and check for XSS as a last resort.
If a site is built with 
2 Rails,
 you might know that URLs
typically follow a /CONTENT_TYPE/RECORD_ID pattern, where the
RECORD_ID is an autoincremented integer. Using HackerOne as
an example, report URLs follow the pattern
[www.hackerone.com/reports/12345](http://www.hackerone.com/reports/12345). Rails applications
commonly use integer IDs, so you might prioritize testing
insecure direct object reference vulnerabilities because this
vulnerability type is easy for developers to overlook.
If an API returns 
3 :***JSON or XML***
, you might recognize that
those API calls unintentionally return sensitive information
that isn’t rendered on the page. Those calls might be a good
testing surface and could lead to information disclosure
vulnerabilities.
Here are some factors to keep in mind at this stage:
Content formats a site expects or accepts For example,
XML files come in different shapes and sizes, and XML
parsing can always be associated with XXE vulnerabilities.
Keep an eye out for sites that accept .docx, .xlsx, .pptx, or
other XML file types.
Third-party tools or services that are easily
misconfigured Whenever you read reports about hackers
exploiting such services, try to understand how those
reporters discovered the vulnerability and apply that
process to your testing.
Encoded parameters and how an application handles
them Oddities might be indicative of multiple services
interacting in the backend, which could be abused.
Custom implemented authentication mechanisms, such
as OAuth flows Subtle differences in how an application
handles redirect URLs, encoding, and state parameters
might lead to significant vulnerabilities.
